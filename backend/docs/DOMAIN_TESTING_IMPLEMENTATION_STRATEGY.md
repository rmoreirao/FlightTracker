# Domain Testing Implementation Strategy

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for implementing domain/unit testing for the Flight Tracker project, following the technical requirement of **xUnit + AutoFixture with 80% coverage gate**.

### Key Requirements Met
- ✅ xUnit as primary testing framework
- ✅ AutoFixture for test data generation
- ✅ 80% line coverage gate enforcement
- ✅ Clean Architecture & DDD testing patterns
- ✅ CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

---

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure domain logic reliability through comprehensive testing
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes early in development cycle
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of domain behavior
4. **Confidence**: Enable safe refactoring and feature development

### Success Metrics
- 80% minimum line coverage across domain layer
- All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- Fast test execution (< 30 seconds for full suite)
- High test maintainability and readability

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Test Project Structure
```
FlightTracker.Domain.Tests/
├── 📁 Base/           # Abstract base classes and common test patterns
├── 📁 Builders/       # Fluent test data builders
├── 📁 Fixtures/       # AutoFixture customizations and test data
├── 📁 Entities/       # Entity behavior tests
├── 📁 ValueObjects/   # Value object immutability and equality tests
├── 📁 Services/       # Domain service tests with mocking
├── 📁 Events/         # Domain event tests
└── 📁 TestResults/    # Generated coverage reports and test output
```

### Testing Patterns

#### 1. Entity Testing Pattern
```csharp
public class FlightTests : EntityTestBase<Flight>
{
    protected override Flight CreateValidEntity() => 
        FlightBuilder.Create().AsOneWay("JFK", "LAX", DateTime.Today.AddDays(1)).Build();

    protected override void AssertEntitiesAreEqual(Flight entity1, Flight entity2)
    {
        entity1.Id.Should().Be(entity2.Id);
    }

    // Inherits: Equality, HashCode, Business Logic tests
}
```

#### 2. Value Object Testing Pattern
```csharp
public class MoneyTests : ValueObjectTestBase<Money>
{
    protected override Money CreateValidValueObject() => new(100.50m, "USD");
    protected override Money CreateDifferentValueObject() => new(200.75m, "EUR");

    // Inherits: Equality, Immutability, HashCode tests
    // Custom: Business logic specific to Money
}
```

#### 3. Domain Service Testing Pattern
```csharp
public class FlightServiceTests : DomainServiceTestBase
{
    private readonly Mock<ICacheService> _mockCache;
    private readonly FlightService _service;

    // Setup, test business logic, verify interactions
}
```

## 📊 Coverage Strategy

### Coverage Targets by Component

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Priority | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| **Value Objects** | 90% | 85% | High | 🟡 In Progress |
| **Entities** | 85% | 80% | High | 🟡 In Progress |
| **Domain Services** | 80% | 75% | High | 🔴 Pending |
| **Domain Events** | 75% | 70% | Medium | 🔴 Pending |
| **Enums** | 100% | N/A | Low | 🔴 Pending |
| **Overall Target** | **80%** | **75%** | **Critical** | **🟡 60%** |

### Coverage Exclusions
- Infrastructure code (Program.cs, Startup.cs)
- Auto-generated code
- Simple property accessors
- Exception message strings
- Obsolete/deprecated methods

### Quality Gates
1. **Build Gate**: 80% line coverage required for merge
2. **PR Gate**: Coverage cannot decrease
3. **Release Gate**: All tests must pass
4. **Performance Gate**: Test suite must complete in < 60 seconds
